# Cleanup Summary

## ðŸ§¹ Cleaned Up Files and Directories

### Removed Large Build Artifacts (saved ~400MB)
- âœ… `/client/dist/` - Built client files
- âœ… `/desktop/dist/` - Built desktop application (~336MB)
- âœ… `/static-demo/dist/` - Built static demo files
- âœ… `/desktop/uploads/` - Old test upload files
- âœ… Removed unused `server/chunkedUpload.js` and `desktop/server/chunkedUpload.js`
- âœ… Removed empty `/landing-page/` directory

### Cleaned Up Code
- âœ… Removed commented out HTML sections in `client/index.html`
- âœ… Fixed malformed download button HTML
- âœ… Updated `.gitignore` to exclude upload directories

### Enhanced Build Scripts
- âœ… Added `clean` script to remove build artifacts
- âœ… Added `clean:deep` script for full cleanup including node_modules

### Project Structure Decisions
- âœ… **Kept both `/server` and `/desktop/server`** - They serve different purposes:
  - `/server` - ES modules, web-only deployment
  - `/desktop/server` - CommonJS, electron integration, desktop features
- âœ… **Kept `/static-demo`** - Independent deployment for Vercel
- âœ… **Kept duplicate videos** - Required for static-demo independence

### Minor Code Simplifications
- âœ… Deduplicated timeout call in `server/server.js`

## ðŸ“Š Final Stats
- **Files cleaned**: 46 source files (0.7MB total)
- **Space saved**: ~400MB in build artifacts
- **Duplicate server code**: Justified (different module systems & features)
- **Duplicate video files**: Justified (deployment independence)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Run `npm run clean` to remove build artifacts
- Run `npm run clean:deep` for complete cleanup
- Build files are now properly excluded from git via `.gitignore`
